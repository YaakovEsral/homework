How to get the pictures aligned properly?
issue: header text is centered, but caption text is left-aligned

possible solution:
justify content center to header is centered. should not take up more than
its container, therefore it should work.

text align left on caption. should work, as the container is still centered,
but its content is left aligned.

how to lay out media group and media single?

grid for group. lay out each media single in flex container, and lay each out in
group. (good from design perspective to use grid on the group in case of more
products).

possible that you could also use flex on the group since it's just one line. you
could probably make it work.

how to make media resizable?
probably use max-width 100%

issue: seems like the video height is a pixel shorter than image height
not sure how to resolve
possible solution: googled it. used object-fit: fill. alt: object-fit: cover;

fix: 
bottom margin (last section) - solved! transparent border to prevent margin 
collapse
padding for form section - fixed!
align header and footer text - fixed! though wondering if there's a better way

shadow and styled input boxes + diff fonts
media alignment-text aligned with image, remove extra space
