Goal:
Consider different options for using local storage (array, one img at a time) - done!

Possible idea: each time an item is moved (on mouseup), save that item inside an
array. Save the item itself as an object, storing its name and coordinates (key
and value). The result will be the image object with its info inside an array.
The array will be used for storing each of the image objects.

The outer storage will be an array. The advantage of using an array is that you can loop
through it. The advantage of an object is that you can use key value pairs and easily access
an item through its key. However, looping through an object is less conventional. We
will use an array and access the values using indexOf method.

New plan:
instead of worrying about how everything will look, I have a new plan.
Everything will be displayed in a single scroll window.
There will be two buttons: Save and Start Over.
Start Over will return everything to its original state (refresh or remove position absolute?).
Save will add everything to local storage.
Before the save button is clicked, everything will be saved in the array. Upon clicking the save
button, the elements will be added to local storage.
